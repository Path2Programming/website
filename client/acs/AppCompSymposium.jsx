                        between urban and rural computer science education! Organized by Adi Gollamudi in collaboration
                        with Bitsource and Cedar Inc., this event invites professors from around the country to spend a few days
                        in Eastern Kentucky, showcasing their work and passions with the youth and educators of Eastern Kentucky
                        from local high schools and community colleges. Our goals are to: Inspire students with cutting-edge research
                        and CS career opportunities, foster connections between academia and rural communities and
                        contribute to the advancement of STEM education in Appalachia.</p>
